# SusAlert
SusAlert is an alt1 toolkit app for the croesus bossfight, it keeps track of croesus' attacks and provides you with visual and (optional) audio cues. It can also display the status of the crystal mask spell, and alert you when it expires.

## How to use
SusAlert is very easy to use, simply install and open the plugin in alt1 toolkit. It will automatically detect when the croesus fight starts and ends! Some features can be enabled and disabled in the settings, which can be accessed by pressing the cog icon in the top right.

The timer may drift out of sync after the mid fungi (attack phase) due to the variable nature of this part of the fight, but this can be manually synced by clicking the sync button (or press alt + 1) when the mid fungi dies, it's also possible to tweak the timing in the settings.

## Requirements
To function SusAlert needs the following:
- Alt1 toolkit must be installed, you can install that [here](https://runeapps.org/alt1).
- The bosstimer must be visible on-screen, this can be changed in Gameplay Settings > Interfaces > Information Windows > Boss kill timer.
- Interface scaling needs to be at 100% (this is the default).
- Game messages need to be turned on (plugin is tested with fontsize 12).
- Any interface transparency should work, if you do encounter issues try setting the interface transparency to below 50%.
